# track_it
Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. I can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the APl and I will create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/ application is created using the most modern JavaScript syntax. I used React Hooks, APl data fetching, all of it in React JS.
